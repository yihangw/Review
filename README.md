# Review

The 2017 is coming and I really appreciate what I have experienced the past 2016. One of the important things that deserved mention is that I believe I have found what I want to devote my whole life to--biophysics. 

Another thing that I might never experience again is the application for the graduate program. I think it is an important process for me reflect on myself and think about what I want to be in the future. A byproduct of this process is that I realize I have to practice my writing skills. When writing my PS or SOP, I find it hard to express my idea like a native speaker and it is not hard to find some grammar mistakes. As a physicist, telling a good story must be an important part of my job. Also, ‘what I cannot create, I do not understand.' By reviewing some articles, I could form a general picture of the field of biophysics.

I think it would be wise to set some rules for myself and some warnings for you guys. After all, I'm a lazy stupid man. So here we go:

Rules:

1. I will review one paper every four days. If the paper is over 10 pages (references are not included), I will review 6 pages every four days. (I have tested my speed by trying to review some articles. So far I’m really slow so I think this setting is reasonable. By reasonable I mean it is a challenge but no unconquerable.) 

2. I will keep doing this for 6 months. So it is reasonable to expect that I will upload about 45 reviews in total.

3. If for some reason I fail to upload the review on time. Please forgive me because this practice is only a small part of my life. I hope it will be an enjoyable process so I won't push myself too hard. But I promise that before the end of 2017, you will find I have submitted 45 reviews.

4. It is fine for me to just summary a part of an article.

5. Since the aim of this practice is to improve my writing skills. I would really appreciate if you can help to point out some grammar mistakes and help me to improve my expression. Of course, I would be glad if you are interested in one of those topics and would like to have a discussion with me.

6. I will begin this practice as quickly as possible. I guess I will upload a new review at the middle of January, 2017. Once I upload a new review, that means the practice begins.

7. If I fail to persist long enough, please encourage me......

8. Let me know if you think I could do better.


Warning:

1. If you are interested in topics in biophysics, you can just discuss with me but don't try to learn biophysics systematically by following my reviews. I believe that they will not be well-organized. Also, some articles I review may be out-of-date and I just want to know how people thought about those problems in the past. But I will try to review some interesting topics.

2. I can't guarantee that I understand what I read in a correct way. 

3. About copy right. I will try to cite all the references except the article that I review. Please let me know if it is not enough. 

4. I'm not only a beginner of biophysics, but also a beginner of Github. If I do something terrible, that only means I'm learning something new.


It seems that I have said too much. Thank you for your reading and hope you enjoy your 2017.
